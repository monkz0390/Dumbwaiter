# Dumbwaiter
the code in this branch is a continuation of the previous code
the main difference beinf that this code uses 2 arduinos
using serial communication it allows for a distance between arduinos
this same code can be used with XBees!
for the sake of simplicity i used the default Tx(1) and Rx(0) pins
